# UFO
Module 11
Deliverable 2 Instructions
For your written analysis, be sure to use complete and coherent sentences. Your written analysis should contain three sections, which cover the following:

Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

**OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS**
The purpose of this challenge was to compile a UFO data into a cohesive table that is able to be filtered by various metrics.  Javascript was used to compile the data into an array that we were ablet o feature as a table with filtering capabilities on our web page.  Javascript was the ideal language to visually display our results, and HTML made it possible to compile our results to our web page.  The combination of both laguages made for an easy to navigate and visually sophisticated UFO sighting website


**RESULTS**

As shown in the below image, we developed a conveinient and attractive website to filter results from our table.  During the challenge we added options for filtering based on city, state, country, and shape of the object reported.

**SUMMARY**
Though most of the developments were positive, there were some drawbacks to this new design.  For one, without the presence of a button, anytime the user makes a mistake the web page automatically updates instead of waiting until the user is ready to filter the results.  Another drawback is that the data the user is searching for has to be an exact match.  If it is off by one day, or the format of the input is not correct, nothing will show up.  A way to potentially improve the website would be to show any UFO sightings reported in a 5 day window of the entered date, with the most accurate at the top of the list.  Further more, the button should be replaced for filtering so the user can check their work without it automatically updating
